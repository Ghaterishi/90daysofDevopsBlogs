As we saw some basic commands in the last blog, let's deep divine into more file manipulation commands.

### üìåIntroduction to Text Editor:

If we want to create and edit the file we need a text editor like Notepad. There are so many editors in Linux like Nano, vi and Vim, but Vim is wide because of its simplicity. we are also using Vim through this blog.

Different modes of Vim editor,

* insert mode - press i
    
* save the added content - press:w
    
* quit the editor mode- press:q
    

### üóÇÔ∏èCreation of files:

* ‚úÖTo create an empty file,
    
    ```plaintext
    user@hostip:~$ touch first_file.txt
    ```
    
* ‚úÖTo create a file and saved content in it,
    

> üî∫note: if you just print something on-screen use echo "my\_content", this is not saved content in any file.

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ echo "Learning Devops" > devops.txt
```

### üìÅEditing files using Vim editor:

* ‚úÖLet's create a file and add some content to it,
    

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ touch fruits.txt

user@hostip:~$ vim fruits.txt
- Apple
- Mango
- Banana
- Cherry
- kiwi
- orange
- Guava

:wq
```

> üî∫note: after writing to save the file press ESC and press:wq (write and quiet) it will save the file and get of the editor.

* ‚úÖTo view the starting or ending of specific lines,
    
    ```plaintext
    user@hostip:~$ head -n 3 fruits.txt
    output:
    - Apple
    - Mango
    - Banana
    
    user@hostip:~$ tail -n 3 fruits.txt
    output:
    - kiwi
    - orange
    - Guava
    ```
    
* ‚úÖTo create and add content using a single command,
    
    ```plaintext
    user@hostip:~$ vim colors.txt
    - Red
    - Pink
    - white
    - Black
    - Blue
    - Orange
    - purple
    - Grey
    :wq
    ```
    
* ‚úÖTo view the content of the file
    

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ cat colors.txt
```

### üßêCheck the difference between the two files:

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ diff fruits.txt colors.txt
output:
< Apple
< MAngo
< BAnana
< Cherry
< Kiwi
< Orange
< Guva
---
> - Red
> - Pink
> - white
> - Black
> - Blue
> - Orange
> - purple
> - Grey
```

### ‚ùåDeletion of files:

* ‚úÖTo delete the directory,
    
    ```plaintext
    user@hostip:~$ rm -d <dir_name>
    ```
    
* ‚úÖTo delete the file,
    
    ```plaintext
    user@hostip:~$ rm <file_name>
    ```
    
* ‚úÖTo delete the directory and files inside it forcefully,(not recommended)
    

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ rm -rf <dir_name>
```

### üîÅHistory of your session:

* ‚úÖTo check which commands you run till now,
    

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ history
output:
touch first_file.txt
echo "Learning Devops" > devops.txt
touch fruits.txt
vim fruits.txt
head -n 3 fruits.txt
tail -n 3 fruits.txt
vim colors.txt
cat colors.txt
diff fruits.txt colors.txt
rm -d <dir_name>
rm <file_name>
rm -rf <dir_name>
```

> protip: If you want to check all the functions or options available with any particular command use manual (man) before the command,
> 
> ```plaintext
> user@hostip:~$ man -tail
> ```

### Managing file permission:

In Ubuntu there are three entities user(u), the owner(o), and group(g) and three permission reda(r), write(w), and execute (x).

we can the permission using changemod(chmod) command, for append the permission use + and for removing permission use -,

* To add the write permission for the current user,
    

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ chmod u+w colors.txt
```

* To remove the read permission for the group,
    

```plaintext
user@hostip:~$ chmod g-r devops.txt
```

### üîÖconclusion:

Above mentioned commands give you a good understanding of how to play with Vim Editor and terminal. I highly suggest you go and get your hands dirty in this.
