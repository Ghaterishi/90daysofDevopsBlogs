### 📌What is Git and why is it important?

Git is an open-source software made for managing our code repositories efficiently and establishing better coordination between different coders. The main feature of git is all coders can create their local copy of the repository.

### 📌What is GitHub?

GitHub is also the same software as Git it manages our repositories. It is a place where we store repository, if anyone wants to create their local copy or want to check the code it's a place to find it.

### 📌Difference between Git and Git Hub?

Git is used for managing repositories locally. It is a command line tool which interacts with GitHub, using git only we can do all kinds of operations like clone, add, push, commit etc.

Otherhand, Github uses GUI, it's used for better management of repositories and also we can store our repo here safely. if somehow our Local copy gets deleted then we can recover it from GitHub.

### 📌What is the difference between local & remote repositories? How to connect local to remote?

Local repo is a repo stored on your local system or machine and remote repo means a repo, stored on servers like GitHub, Bitbucket etc.

If you want to get to know about how connect to from local to remote go and read my following block. Also after reading this blog, we will get to know

* How to create repositories on GitHub,
    
* How to make a local copy from it and
    
* How to push it on GitHub.

### 📌Branches in git.

To understand the branch let's consider one scenario if there is a repo in Git Hub and three coders working on it each want their separate copy of the repo and after adding some features in the code they push that particular branch. with the help of a branch, we can track the record of code which developer code is better. Other than this branching is also used for isolating the environment like development, staging and production.

In Git, both the "main" and "master" branches are used to keep track of different versions of your project. However, they have slightly different names.

* The "master" branch is an older term that has been traditionally used as the default branch name in Git repositories.
    
* The "main" branch is a more modern and inclusive term that some projects now use instead of "master."
    

Functionally, there is no significant difference between the two branches. They both serve as the main line of development for your project.

### 📌Set your user name and email address, which will be associated with your commits.

If you're using Git and want to set your user name and email address to be associated with your commits, you can do so globally for all repositories on your machine using the following commands:

```plaintext
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 📌Conclusion:

After going through this blog you understand how to set up Git for your project and its basic operations also you get a basic understanding of git, GitHub and how it works. I encouraged you to go and follow the steps mentioned in the blog so you will understand better.
